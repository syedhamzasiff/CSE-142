/*
Create a class called ”Book” that has the following properties:
• Title (string)
• Author (string)
• ISBN (string)
• Number of pages (int)
Create a constructor that initializes the properties of the book, and create a method called “summary” that
returns a string containing the title, author, ISBN, and number of pages of the book.
Create a main method that creates an object of the Book class and sets its properties using the constructor.
Then, call the summary method and print the result.
